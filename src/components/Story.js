        Poketo’s first artist wallet series launched in San Francisco along with
        the first art show where the wallets sold out. We had late nights at
        Angie’s art school to print the first series of wallets. That first
        series and art show was such a success, it inspired us to start Poketo.
        The name Poketo comes from Angie’s Korean grandmother's mispronunciation
        of “pocket”. Poh-Keh-Toe.

      <p className={stl.p}>
        We moved down to LA to focus on Poketo and moved into Ted’s parents’
        house. This helped us grow the business and keep our overhead low. More
        and more of our favorite shops started to reach out and carry Poketo
        products as our online presence grew.

      <p className={stl.p}>
        We eventually moved out of the parents’ house to Echo Park, Los Angeles.
        We ventured into tees, bags, and housewares, expanding what “art every
        day” could be. It was still just the two of us, working day and night,
        doing everything from design, pick, pack, and ship.

        Poketo was invited to collaborate with artists in Australia, Spain,
        Scotland, and Japan. In each of these countries, we created Poketo
        artist series collections. We outgrew our home office and moved into a
        1100 square foot loft in Downtown LA and hired our first full-time
        staff. Our new HQ became the space for Poketo art shows and events

        Poketo has collaborated on band merch with some of our favorite bands:
        Postal Service, Arcade Fire, Weezer, The Shins, Coachella, and more. For
        our pop up in Scotland, Stevie Jackson of Belle and Sebastian plays an
        intimate set with friends.

        We were on the cover page of the LA TImes business section. Same year,
        we threw a large art show and our friends, Portugal The Man, played a
        free concert for hundreds of fans. This year was the beginning of a
        dream collaboration with Target, we created a 52 piece accessory
        collection for the retail giant that was sold in over 1700 stores in the
        USA and Canada

        Growing out of our first loft office, we found a 4000 sqf space in back
        then very quiet LA’s Arts District and turned it into Poketo’s HQ, a
        place for retail, workshops, events, and a gallery space. More national
        and international press like Wall Paper, Monocle, and NYT as well as
        companies like American Express and Toyota featured Poketo in their
        national advertising campaigns.

        Poketo launched a creative workshops program and since then, hundreds of
        workshops were held teaching thousands of attendees on everything from
        Kimchi making ( Taught by Angie’s mom) to calligraphy, to lighting
        design. The Poketo workshops were all taught by our community of
        designers and entrepreneurs, including Lotta Jansdotter, Hrishikesh
        Hirway, Adi Goodrich, Emily Katz, Brendan Ravenhill, Lorien Stern,
        Chiaozza, Sonoko Sakai, Éva Goicochea of Maude, Monica Khemsurov of

        Poketo opened its second shop in The Line Hotel in Koreatown, a shop for
        the discerning travelers where we also took over the gallery
        installation of the lobby and hosted conversations with different
        artists. We also popped up at Nordstrom, duplicating the Poketo retail
        experience inside 8 national flagships across the country. This was also
        the first year we started holding company retreats. The retreats were a
        time to celebrate our accomplishments and set our paths years to come.

        We continued pop-ups with MOCA, Casetify, Everlane, Baggu, Hem, Dims,
        Join, Korea Institute of Design Promotion, and Urban Outfitters. Not
        only brands but independent artists Ellen Van Dusen, Lisa Congdon,
        Ladies & Gentleman, Eric Trine, Will Bryant, Chiaozza, and Sean Knibb
        had shows and collaborations. We grew to 4 Poketo locations to bring the
        Poketo community together across sprawling Los Angeles. Poketo created a
        licensing program and over the years have collaborated with Beyond Yoga,
        Takenaka, Corkcicle, Chronicle, Thousand, and more. Poketo was awarded
        the Edge Award by the Los Angeles Design Festival for positive community

        Our first book, Creative Spaces, with Chronicle Books, was published
        about the homes, studios, and lives of artists, designers, and
        entrepreneurs. We held a national book tour, hosting discussions with
        designers in LA, SF, Seattle, Vancouver, Boston, New York, Austin,
        Denver, and Seoul. We were also invited to speak with corporate teams at
        Starbucks, Microsoft, and Google. The LA Times featured Ted & Angie’s
        home, our own creative living space in Los Angeles.

        The global pandemic hits. Angie, Ted, and the small but mighty Poketo
        team roll up their sleeves and fulfill, pack, and ship all your online
        orders. Without your outpouring of support, we wouldn’t have survived
        last year. It was a year of change and reset for Poketo, luckily we were
        able to pivot quickly, allowing us to forge a sustainable path forward.
        We were thrilled to finally reopen our shops in Little Tokyo & Row DTLA
        in July welcoming our customers back in real life.

        Angeles on stationery, caps, socks, bamboo and glass tabletop, textiles,
        and more. What’s next? Be assured that we will continue our aim to
        inspire, to bring joy and art to everyday life, and to uplift our

      <h1 className={stl.h2}>ABOUT US</h1>
      <p className={stl.p}>
        Founded in 2003 by husband-and-wife team Ted Vadakan and Angie Myung,
        Poketo has grown from a small startup into a creative hub and online
        destination. A lifestyle brand born out of the desire to infuse art and
        design into every day, Poketo creates collections of design-conscious
        goods to cultivate a creative lifestyle.
      </p>
      <p className={stl.p}>
        The name Poketo (pronounced “poh-keh-toe”) stems from the
        mispronunciation of “pocket” by Angie’s grandmother. It tied in
        perfectly with the first product ever created under Poketo: a series of
        artist wallets that fit right in your pocket—and Ted and Angie just
        loved the way it sounded.
      </p>
      <p className={stl.p}>
        In addition to its online store, Poketo has a LA-based retail location
        in Little Tokyo of DTLA which hosts art exhibitions, workshops and other
        events that serve to foster the local creative community.
      </p>
      <p className={stl.p}>
        Poketo has worked with brands and companies like Nike, MTV, Disney,
        Target, Nordstrom and MailChimp, museums like MOCA, the Guggenheim, the
        de Young, and SFMOMA, and has collaborated with over 200 international
        artists, creating exclusive products that reflect its philosophy of “Art
        for Your Every day.”
